## About this website
### Purposes
- The primary purpose of creating this website is to **`find better job opportunities`**. It helps potential employers understand the areas of expertise I am familiar with, the technologies I use, the products I have developed, and evaluate the value and productivity I can bring to their organization. Additionally, this **`serves as a springboard for my career transition in the future`**. With the rise of many new technologies and popular emerging professions, I can incorporate relevant content on my website to facilitate my future career shifts.
- Secondly, I **`needed something to fill the long nights`** when I had no other hobbies. I used to enjoy playing video games, but now I find myself growing weary of the fleeting joy they bring. If a hobby can both improve myself and serve as entertainment, that would undoubtedly be ideal.  
- Lastly, **`building a personal website of my own has always been one of my dreams`**. I have long envisioned what my own website could do and the functionalities it might include. Many of these features I plan to implement gradually, though Iâ€™m uncertain if I can accomplish some of the more challenging ones. Who knows? Perhaps I will succeed.
